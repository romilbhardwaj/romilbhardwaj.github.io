## Madeon - Miracle 
### Good Faith, 2019
~110 BPM

Note for Guitar: Can do Cadd9 without pinky on the e for a different tone

I've been try(*Cadd9*)ing to be

every ma(*Cmaj9*)n you saw in me

But in my eyes (*Bm*) they just flicker out

Before I go (*Am*), I'll know (*Dmaj6? Dsus4?*)

and blur like (*Em7*) ghosts, mmm


Can you show me a miracle?

I wish I'd stay the night

but I've got to go

to America

And this could take a while

Isn't it in time that I come alive?

And isn't this life, but I don't know how

And so I'll go

So I'll go
