*WIP: Chorus sounds a bit wrong*

## ODESZA - Higher Ground 
### A Moment Apart - 2018
~105 BPM
Capo: 3

Note: The chords arent true to record but much easier to play transposed on the guitar
Dx can be played as a simple D or C +1 step

(*G*)Ain't no sur(*Am*)prise
(*E*)That I can't sleep tonight

(*G*)My only vi(*Am*)ce
(*E*)Is standing by your side

(*C*)So won't you love me be(*G*)tter
(*Dx*)I'm waiting here
I need you no(*A*)w

(*C*) Gravity can't hold us do(*G*)wn
(*Dx*)So just take me there
To higher grou(*A*)nd

(*C*) Save me
I'm (*G*) holding onto you
My sun is (*Dx*) fading
I'm falling into b(*A*)lue
Why don't you (*C*) save me
My blo(*G*)od is running cold
So li(*Dx*)ft me up
And get me to higher g(*A*)round
