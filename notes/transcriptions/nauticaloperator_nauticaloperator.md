### Verse

Em G D A

In a deep, deep dream one night

A man's mind molds a wooden boat

He puts it in the water

And expects that it will float

The ship is only halfway complete

He lacked supplies to make all the rest

Surely he will sink fast

But I wonder,

Will he jump ship and fail the test?


An island appears,

Relieves his fears

Of never making it back out of this place

Or should he stay here and drown away,

Just to ignore the people and their race?



The island sounds like a better choice

I'll make a life for myself out here

And if I'm lucky, they'll never find me

And my tracks will disappear

Seems to good to be true though

So there's gotta be a catch or a trick

Maybe I'll figure it out

Take a different route

But for now I think I'll stick with my pick


You always wonder what will happen to you,

Maybe you focus on irrelevant things

This island always will be waiting for you

Just thank the future for it's kind offerings


Stuck in the background

Sail out again
