### Good Faith, 2019

Capo: 3rd Fret

Single down strum on each bar

How can I expla(F)in?

Can you ima(Em)gine i(Am)t?

Trying my be(F)st

Trying to fi(Em)nd happi(Am)ness

If I belo(F)ng

If I had a ho(Em)me anywhe(Am)re

It's in your heart(F)beat

Let me b(Em)e the(Am)re

Heavy with ho(F)ping

That you kn(C)ow it

That you fe(Em)el the way I do(Am)

Show me you're bro(F)ken

'Cause I'm fro(C)zen

'Cause I'm sti(Em)ll in love with yo(Am)u

Shut me u(F)p

Shoot me do(C)wn before I

Break and te(Em)ll the tru(Am)th

Heavy with ho(F)ping

Heavy with ho(F)ping

you lo(Em)ve me too(Am)
