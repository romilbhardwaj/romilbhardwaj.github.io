# A disorganized guide to running in Berkeley

## California-Dwight-Spaulding-Addison Loop
Asphalt. Great for speedwork without going to a track. Blocks are 200m. Bike lanes are wide and can be used for running (run on the left side).

## Edwards Stadium
Synthetic. Regular running track, nothing special.

## UC Berkeley Campus
Asphalt. Slightly hilly. The 6% grade on Campanile way makes for nice sprint time trials.

## Big C via Cyclotron Road and Foothill parking lot
Dirt + asphalt. Upto 25% grade. Great for days you hate yourself. Nice views from the top, including a perfectly symmetrical alignment of the campanile with the golden gate bridge.

## Clark Kerr Track
Dirt. I don't think there exists a nicer dirt track than this in the Bay area. Sits midway up a hill, has bars for calisthenics. Great views of the bay. Easy access to Skyline ridge for hill work. 

## Skyline ridge and Fire trails
Dirt/trail. Nice loops for trail running. I recommend start from the Clark Kerr track, climb up to the skyline ridge, join the upper fire trails [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B052'29.3%22N+122%C2%B013'40.9%22W/@37.874794,-122.2302277,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x808579363a8549d3:0x94ea1595a675e993!2sBerkeley,+CA!3b1!8m2!3d37.8715226!4d-122.273042!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d37.8747939!4d-122.2280388?hl=en) till Lawrence Hall of Science and then taking the residential streets down to north Berkeley.

## Berkeley Marina
Asphalt. Cesar Chavez Park has a mostly flat ~2.2 km loop. Great views of the Bay. Careful, the track edges are raised and its easy to twist your ankles if you pay too much attention to the views.
