# Transitioning from a PC to Mac
02/22/2023

## Things that don't work
* Mac can't control volume of speakers attached to a external display 
  * because Macs do not support CEC
* No tools exist to view archives before extracting them
* No easy way to get path in finder
* Ubuntu has better window management (window snapping etc.) and that's saying something
* What to do with wasted screen space around the dock at the bottom?
* No "cut" in finder is a bit confusing
* No gaming - if nothing, I could play games from early 2000s on my thinkpad :(
* Mouse speed is not consistent across displays
* Inconsistencies when connecting to external non-mac keyboards (command is no longer to the left of the spacebar)

## Lifesaver software which make Mac usable
* Karabiner - for remapping keys
* Alttab
* Logitech MX Master

## Things I like
* Good hardware (Displays, processor)
