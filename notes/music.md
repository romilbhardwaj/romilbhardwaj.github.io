This is a list of artists I feel more people should listen to and support. TODO: Add why and a short description.

### Madeon
Honestly, I'm amazed at the sheer complexity of the Madeon project. Madeon's music is incredible and I will write in detail some other time, but what really blows me away is the sheer amount of effort Hugo Leclercq has put in to make Madeon's alternate universe elusive but consistent in it's visuals, lore and ambience. Hugo always seems to go one step beyond, not only in terms of his production but also with every piece of related artwork and visual content that he creates. 

Madeon's ARG (alternate reality game) has some of the best brain twisting puzzles, cryptography and digital stenography challenges I've seen put out by any artist. If you are into treasure hunts, puzzles and audio production, you will be hard pressed to find anything as fun as what Madeon has put together. See the current progress of the Madeon fanbase on his puzzles [here](https://app.milanote.com/1K6AHK1oYXIdaR/madeon-good-faith-era-visual-timeline?p=dTTCt9pEIXE) and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1drmb4PvNJcGLfFjHiuw66r8qQ61dgat4_vOlP2-AmHw/edit). EDIT: It was solved, [here's](https://old.reddit.com/r/madeon/comments/ikbinl/a_full_detailed_explanation_on_the_arg_and_how_we/) a nice recap of the hunt which ended in a limited edition vinyl.
